# FFT

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a function.

Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The Fourier Transform is given by:

This repository contains a Python script which reads an audio file, computes its frequency components, applies filtering using FFT, and then outputs an amplified and filtered audio file.
